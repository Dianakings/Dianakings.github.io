     <h2>Cancun</h2>
     <p><br>
    <h2>
     <p>Sunny Cancun has much more to offer than its party-town reputation might suggest. Plenty of gorgeous, drama-free family resorts cater to folks who want to experience the tropical Yucatan climate. There are significant Mayan ruins here, such as El Rey and the Yamil Lu’um, a crumbling tower of pale gray stone. Learn more about this ancient civilization at the Museo Maya de Cancun. For a literal taste of Mexico, take a tour of the Museo Sensorial del Tequila.</p>

 <h2>Puerto Vallarta</h2>
 <p><br>
    <h2>
     <p>Strolling, shopping, and sipping tequila along the Malecon boardwalk of Puerto Vallarta is the best way to kick off your vacation. Then hit the cobblestone streets of Old Vallarta to browse the flea market for handmade crafts. The calm, warm waters of the Bay of Banderas make for excellent diving, or you can just watch artists sculpt spectacular creations in the sand. The cluster of fine art galleries in El Centro are perfect spots to hit on a self-guided art tour.</p>

<h2>Punta De Mita </h2>
<p><br>
    <h2>
        <p>Yearning for the laidback feel of a rural fishing village with white sand beaches, combined with the luxuries and mild year-round weather of the Mexican Riviera? Punta Mita has all this plus championship golf, diving, sport fishing, surfing, sailing, sea kayaking, whale watching, mountain biking, hiking, horseback riding, Jeep tours, and rainforest excursions. Walk into town for beachfront restaurant dining and Pacific Ocean sunsets. Kids can safely swim at Playa El Anclote, where the rock jetties calm the shallow waters near restaurant row. Surf El Anclote’s long slow waves. Or seek out those special surfing spots along the coast, like near Punta Sayulita. Enjoy kayaking. Take the family sailing. Tee off overlooking the breezy blue waters of the Pacific Ocean at the Jack Nicklaus-designed Pacifico Course, rated among the best in Latin America. Pacifico is renowned for its optional 19th hole, the “Tail of the Whale,” a 199-yard par-three where you tee off over the Pacific Ocean onto a large island green. The Bahia, another Nicklaus-designed championship course, has six ocean holes, and is lined by beach sands and gated resort properties controlling course access. The Bahia Banderas (Bay of Banderas) and north towards Sayulita is great for fishing and diving volcanic tunnels, or just watching whales, dolphins, turtles, and ocean birds. Snorkel color-splashed shallow reefs. Spend a day on a ponga, a motorized open-bow fishing boat in search of mahi-mahi (dorado), pugnacious pargo (big cubera snapper), Pacific sailfish, fighting roosterfish, yellowfin tuna, and bonita. From Islas Marietas and El Morro to La Corbetena and El Banco, the diving opportunities are numerous.</p>

<h2>Nuevo Vallarta</h2>
<p><br>
    <h2>
      <p>In Nuevo Vallarta, you can lounge on the golden-sand beaches of Banderas Bay… or take an ATV tour through the nearby Sierra Madre jungle. A local water park has great twisting slides and sea lion shows… or you could treat the kids to a memorable swim with dolphins.</p>
