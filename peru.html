     <h2>Pisac</h2>
     <p><br>
    <h2>
     <p>Spread out on the mountains above the bustling colonial village of Pisac are several impressive Inca ruins known as Inca Pisac. The ruins include a military citadel, religious temples, and individual dwellings, and overlooks the Sacred Valley. It is thought that Inca Písac defended the southern entrance to the valley and controlled a route which connected the Inca Empire with the border of the rain forest.</p>

 <h2>The Uros Islands</h2>
 <p><br>
    <h2>
     <p>Made of dried totora reeds, the artificial islands of the Uros are Lake Titicaca’s top tourist attraction. The lives of the Uros, a pre-Incan people, are interwoven with these reeds, which is a primary source of food and are also used to make their homes, their boats and even a reed flower tea. Reeds are added to the top of the islands constantly, about every three months, as they rot from the bottom, so the ground is always soft and springy.</p>

<h2>Chan Chan </h2>
<p><br>
    <h2>
        <p>The vast adobe city of Chan Chan in Peru was once the largest city in pre-Columbian America. It is estimated that around 60,000 people lived in the city. The city was built by the Chimu around 850 AD and lasted until its conquest by the Inca Empire in 1470 AD. Although Chan Chan must have been a dazzling sight at the time, devastating floods and heavy rainfall have severely eroded the mud walls of the city. Today the most impressive aspect of the site is its sheer size.</p>

<h2>Manu National Park</h2>
<p><br>
    <h2>
      <p>This vast national park in the Amazon Basin is one of the best places in South America to see a stunning variety of tropical wildlife. With patience, wildlife is seen in most areas. During a one-week trip, visitors can reasonably expect to see many different bird species, several kinds of monkey and a few other mammals. The best time to visit Manu National Park is during the dry season, between June and November.</p>
